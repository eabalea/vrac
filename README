This is a short guide to start using rndsig.

 - Compile and install it, by running the following:
   ./configure; make; su; make install
 - Create a file containing all the quotes you'd like rndsig to use, one at 
   each line.
 - Create a file in your home directory, named .rndsigrc. This file will
   contain the following keywords:
     Template  followed by the template file   
     Quotes    followed by the quotes file
     Output    followed by the output file
     InsertDashes  followed by a boolean value (yes, no, true, false, 1, 0
                   are recognized)
     Order     followed by one of {Regular, Reverse, Random}
 - Create the output fifo:
     mkfifo "output file"
 - Run the executable
 
Sorry for this very (too) short guide, I'll write a bigger one sometime.
